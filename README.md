# Python Number Guessing Game (v1.0)

## About this project

This project was made for a Python course. It generates a random number and it
will let users try to guess that number, telling them if their guess is higher,
lower, or correct. The game allows users to select from three levels, each with
their own unique number ranges. This game makes use of critical Python concepts
like functions, loops and conditionals.

## Improvements and Optimization

In the future I would like to add a leaderboard to this program that tracks the
best guessers (those that can guess the number in the least amount of tries) and
those that can win in the lest amount of time. I would like to make this a
Django project so that I can maintain this data on a backend.
